# chip8emu-learningproject
A project to learn emulation

This is a hobby project for myself to take some first steps in emulation. On Reddit's EmuDev, developing a Chip-8 emulator was recommended for beginners, so that's the route I took. I am leaning heavily on (http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#font, "Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference") while coding, and parts of it is pasted in as code comments.
